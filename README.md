## About me
Hi! My name is Jay, I am a current third year student of Computer Science in Western University. I am planning to go to USA for my master degree. My career goal is to be a **independent software developer**. I like playing basketball with my friends when I am free, [Kyrie Irving](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%87%AF%E9%87%8C%C2%B7%E6%AC%A7%E6%96%87) is my favorite player. Also I used to play [League of Legends](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E8%8B%B1%E9%9B%84%E8%81%94%E7%9B%9F) with my friends, my favorite player is [Koro1](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%AB%A5%E6%89%AC/19830292).

## Purpose
I create this repository for **practicing my programming skills**. I hope I can familiar with them through this progress.
